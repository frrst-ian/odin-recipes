    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Miso soup is a traditional Japanese soup that starts with a dashi stock
      and is flavored with miso paste. Dashi is an umami-rich stock made from
      dried seaweed and dried fish. Miso paste, meanwhile, is a paste made from
      soybeans, salt, and koji rice.

      feature seaweed, mushrooms, daikon, and more.
